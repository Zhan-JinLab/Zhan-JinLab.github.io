We are excited to launch the new Zhan/Jin Laboratory website! This platform will serve as a hub for sharing our research, connecting with collaborators, and communicating with prospective students and postdoctoral fellows.

## About Our Laboratory

The Zhan/Jin Laboratory is dedicated to advancing cancer neuroscience and immunotherapy for brain tumors. Under the leadership of Honorary Director Professor Zhan Renya and Principal Investigator Dr. Jin Linchun, we integrate cutting-edge research in cancer immunology, CAR-T cell engineering, and neuro-oncology to develop novel therapeutic approaches for glioblastoma and other brain malignancies.

## Our Research Focus

Our laboratory specializes in five interconnected research areas:

- **Cancer Neuroscience**: Understanding the unique neurobiological features of brain tumors
- **Cancer Immunology**: Investigating immune dysfunction and developing strategies to enhance anti-tumor immunity
- **CAR-T Cell Therapy**: Engineering chimeric antigen receptor T cells for solid tumors
- **Glioblastoma Research**: Characterizing treatment resistance mechanisms
- **Neuro-oncology**: Translating discoveries into clinical applications

## Recent Achievements

We are proud of our recent contributions to the field, including:

- Development of novel CAR-T cell therapies targeting CD70 and incorporating CXCR1/2 modifications
- Patent awards for chimeric antigen receptor technologies
- High-impact publications with over 600 citations for our lead articles

## Join Our Team

We welcome motivated individuals passionate about cancer immunotherapy and making a difference in patients' lives. We have opportunities for:

- Ph.D. students in immunology, neuroscience, and bioengineering
- Master's students in tumor immunology and molecular biology
- Postdoctoral fellows seeking advanced training in translational research
- Visiting scholars for collaborative projects

If you are interested in joining our laboratory, please visit our [Contact]({{ '/contact/' | relative_url }}) page or reach out directly to Dr. Jin at [linchun.jin@zju.edu.cn](mailto:linchun.jin@zju.edu.cn).

## What's Next

This website will be regularly updated with:

- News about our latest publications and research findings
- Information about lab members and their projects
- Announcements of seminars and events
- Photos from laboratory activities and conferences

Thank you for visiting, and we look forward to sharing our research journey with you!
