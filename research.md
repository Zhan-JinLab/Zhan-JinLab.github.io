## Overview

Our research program integrates cancer neuroscience, immunology, and cellular engineering to address fundamental challenges in treating glioblastoma and other brain tumors. We employ a multidisciplinary approach combining basic science, translational research, and clinical collaboration to develop next-generation immunotherapies.

## Research Areas

### Cancer Neuroscience

Brain tumors exist in a unique microenvironment shaped by neurons, glia, and specialized immune cells. We investigate how this neuro-immune crosstalk influences tumor growth, invasion, and treatment resistance. Our work explores:

- Mechanisms of neural-tumor interactions
- Role of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in tumor progression
- Impact of neuroinflammation on tumor immunity
- Metabolic adaptations in the brain tumor microenvironment

### Cancer Immunology

The immune landscape of glioblastoma is characterized by profound immunosuppression. We study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying immune dysfunction in brain tumors, including:

- Regulatory T cell (Treg) accumulation and function
- Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages
- Checkpoint molecule expression and immune evasion
- Cytokine and chemokine networks in the tumor microenvironment
- Mechanisms of immunosuppression induced by metabolic dysregulation

### CAR-T Cell Therapy

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy represents a promising approach for glioblastoma treatment. Our laboratory develops novel CAR-T cell engineering strategies to overcome obstacles specific to solid tumors:

- **Target Antigen Discovery**: Identifying and validating tumor-associated antigens including CD70, CXCR1/2, and emerging targets
- **Enhanced Tumor Trafficking**: Engineering CARs with chemokine receptors (e.g., CXCR1/2) to improve T cell migration into tumors
- **Metabolic Optimization**: Modifying CAR-T cells to thrive in the hostile tumor metabolic environment
- **Checkpoint Modulation**: Integrating checkpoint blockade with CAR-T therapy
- **Multi-targeting Strategies**: Developing combination approaches to prevent antigen escape

Notable achievements include the development of CD70-targeted CAR-T cells and CXCR2-modified CAR-T cells that co-opt tumor-derived IL-8 for enhanced chemotaxis and anti-tumor efficacy.

### Glioblastoma Research

Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a median survival of less than 15 months despite aggressive treatment. Our laboratory focuses on:

- Understanding mechanisms of treatment resistance to radiation and chemotherapy
- Identifying biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment response
- Developing combination therapeutic strategies
- Investigating the role of tumor heterogeneity in treatment failure
- Exploring the contribution of glioma stem cells to recurrence

### Neuro-oncology Translational Research

We are committed to translating laboratory discoveries into clinical applications. Our translational efforts include:

- Preclinical validation of novel immunotherapies in patient-derived xenograft models
- Development of IND-enabling studies for CAR-T cell therapies
- Biomarker discovery for clinical trial design
- Collaboration with clinical neuro-oncology teams to inform research priorities
- Investigation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diagnostics for disease monitoring
